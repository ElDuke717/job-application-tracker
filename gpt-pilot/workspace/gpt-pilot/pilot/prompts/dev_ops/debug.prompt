You wanted me to check this - `{{ issue_description }}` but there was a problem
{%- else -%}
Ok, we need to debug this issue
{%- endif -%}
{% if command %} and we need to be able to execute `{{ command }}` successfully. {% else %}.
Here is a brief explanation of what's happening:

{{ context }}
I want you to create a list of steps that are needed to debug this issue.

A step can be either a `command` or `code_change`.

`command` step will run a command on the machine and will return the CLI output to you so you can see what to do next. Note that the command will be run on a {{ os }} machine.

`code_change` step will change the code and you need to thoroughly describe what needs to be implemented. I will implement the requested changes and let you know.

Also, make sure that at least the last step has `check_if_fixed` set to TRUE.

**IMPORTANT**
When you think about in which file should the new code go to, always try to make files as small as possible and put code in more smaller files rather than in one big file. Whenever a file becomes too large (more than 50 lines of code) split it into smaller files.

{# After this, you need to decide what to do next. You can rerun the command `{{ command }}` to check if the problem is fixed or run another command with `run_command` or change more code with `implement_code_changes`. #}
