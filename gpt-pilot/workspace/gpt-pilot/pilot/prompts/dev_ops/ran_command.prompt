{%- if additional_message %}{{ additional_message }}{% endif %}
I ran the command `{{ command }}`. The output was:
{#%- if error_response %}, it {{ error_response }}{% endif %#}
{{ cli_response }}

Think about this output and not any output in previous messages. If the command was successfully executed, respond with `DONE`. If it wasn't, respond with `NEEDS_DEBUGGING`.

Do not respond with anything other than these two keywords.
