I feel pretty good about it, I also applied to a Y-combinator job posting.   I think that if I get started early enough, that I may be able to get more than five applications in in a day.\n\nI also added this journal feature today.  I'm pretty excited about it as it may help add more motivation to the job search and provide more context for each day's application session.\n\nI'd like to figure out a way to streamline applying for jobs, perhaps by developing some Python scripts to help automate the process.",
