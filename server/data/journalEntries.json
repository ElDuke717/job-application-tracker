I feel pretty good about it, I also applied to a Y-combinator job posting.   I think that if I get started early enough, that I may be able to get more than five applications in in a day.\n\nI also added this journal feature today.  I'm pretty excited about it as it may help add more motivation to the job search and provide more context for each day's application session.\n\nI'd like to figure out a way to streamline applying for jobs, perhaps by developing some Python scripts to help automate the process.",

I'll definitely use it again along with the other VC site.  I wonder if I'll have more success with them than LinkedIn and some of the other sites?  \n\nPutting in these applications has been a good way to use and test this application, too.  There was a hiccup with the UUID functionality and finding some of the applications I put in before.\n\n10 applications in a day seems aggressive and I probably was only able to get that many since Y-combinator is fast to apply for.  \n\nI'll have to seek ways to apply for jobs faster so that I can cast a broader net.",
